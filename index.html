  	<h3> What You Need:</h3>
  	<ul class="ingredients">
  		<li>8oz of Cream Cheese</li>

  		<li>A Rotisserie Chicken</li>
  		<li>Garlic Sea Salt</li>
  	</ul>
  	<img src="images/chickenroll.jpg" alt="The Finished Product!" title="Chicken Wrap Ups" class="image" id="mainImage">
  	<p class="directions">First grab your rotisserie chicken and remove as much chicken as you like. (I usually use a half a breast but you can use a whole one if you want your rolls to be more chicken-y) Then make sure that you soften your cream cheese (it makes it easier to mix). Usually taking it out while you cut the chicken will do it but you can always put it in the microwave for about fifteen seconds to speed up this process. </p>
  	
<p>Then you shred your chicken with two forks and season it with garlic sea salt to taste. Once that's done it's as easy as mixing the chicken and cream cheese all together with a spoon or fork.</p>

<p>Once the mixture is nice and mixed, unroll the crescent rolls and then put a large spoonful of the filling in each triangle. You need to use all the filling. Itâ€™s okay if you don't but don't be afraid to use a lot on each section.</p>

<p>Next? Wrap up all the crescent rolls. I've discovered it's easier to just try to let the dough guide you where it wants to go.</p> 

<p>Then stick in the oven and bake whatever temperature and time the tube of crescent rolls says or until they start to look a light brown.</p>

<p>Let them sit for a couple of minutes once you've taken them out and then it's time to eat! </p>
